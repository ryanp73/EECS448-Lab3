          <h1>About Me</h1>  
          <p>Hi my name is Ryan! I am a sophomore computer science and math double major at the University of Kansas. I am from Overland Park, KS where I attended high school at Blue Valley North High School. I am very interested in working in machine learning, hopefully combining ML and sports which are two of my biggest interests. I am involved with several clubs at KU including the Solar Car team, ACM, and the Hackathon planning committee. One thing to know about me is that I am a big procrastinator. I am typing this paragraph the night before this assignment is due. That is a bad habit that I developed in high school. You will see my video attached is a TED Talk about procrastination. Though I haven't actually gotten better, at least I understand it better I guess.</p>
